# Customer Churn Prediction with ML

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Telecom Churn Predictive Analysis project. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques.


## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Iranian Churn Dataset from UCI(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset). It includes features such as call duration, customer satisfaction, and contract information. Preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, handling imbalance dataset and encoding categorical variables.
## Model Training
5 different Models were trained models:
    Logistic Regression,RandomForestClassifier,
    Support Vector Classifier,
    Decision Tree,Extra Trees. 
    
Training multiple models is a good practice to compare their performances and choose the one that best suits your specific problem.
## Evaluation 
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy as the main metric. Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1 score were also considered.Best Model was further evaluated using cross validation  
## Contributing
I'm happy to recieve contributions to this project with the sole aim of leading to valuable improvements and foster collaborations
